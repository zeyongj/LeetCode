<pre>+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| action      | ENUM |
| question_id | int  |
| answer_id   | int  |
| q_num       | int  |
| timestamp   | int  |

There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
action is an ENUM of the type: "show", "answer", or "skip".
Each row of this table indicates the user with ID = id has taken an action with the question question_id at time timestamp.
If the action taken by the user is "answer", answer_id will contain the id of that answer, otherwise, it will be null.
q_num is the numeral order of the question in the current session.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>answer rate</strong> for a question is the number of times a user answered the question by the number of times a user showed the question.</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to report the question that has the highest <strong>answer rate</strong>. If multiple questions have the same maximum <strong>answer rate</strong>, report the question with the smallest <code>question_id</code>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>
