Move Zeroes

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

## Note
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## Examples
- Example 1

  Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
  
  Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
  
- Example 2

  Input: nums = [0]

  Output: [0]
 
## Constraints
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1.

## Follow up
Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
